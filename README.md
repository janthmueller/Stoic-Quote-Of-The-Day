A very ridiculous thing it is, that any man should dispense with vice and wickedness in himself, which is in his power to restrain; and should go about to suppress it in others, which is altogether impossible.

The essence of Marcus Aurelius' thought here is a timeless reminder that self-awareness and personal responsibility are crucial for leading a virtuous life. Often, people are quick to identify and criticize the faults in others while neglecting to address or even acknowledge their own shortcomings. The idea is that while it's a natural human tendency to notice what's wrong with the world or in other people, it's ultimately futile and frustrating because we have no real power to change others unless they themselves choose to change. However, we hold full control over our actions and decisions, making it more effective to focus on improving ourselves. In a contemporary context, this could be seen in a workplace where a manager constantly points out the inefficiencies of their team but fails to address their own leadership flaws. Instead, they would achieve more by modelling the behavior they wish to see, fostering a culture of self-improvement and accountability. The focus on changing what is within one's control can lead to personal growth and set a positive example, potentially inspiring others to follow suit. This approach aligns with the Stoic belief that true power and tranquility come from regulating one's own mind and actions, rather than attempting to control external situations or people.
