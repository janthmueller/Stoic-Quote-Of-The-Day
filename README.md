Thus the time we are given is not brief, but we make it so. We do not lack time; on the contrary, there is so much of it that we waste an awful lot.

Seneca's insight speaks to our modern experience of feeling overwhelmed by time's relentless pace, suggesting that the real issue lies not in its insufficiency but in our inefficient use of it. In today's world, with endless digital distractions and the constant buzz of notifications, it's easy to let precious hours slip by unnoticed. We often find ourselves lamenting, "If only there were more hours in a day," when, in reality, the problem is not the scarcity of time but how we prioritize and manage it. Instead of being consumed by trivial pursuits or procrastination, focusing on what truly matters can help us make the most of each day. By cultivating mindfulness and setting clear intentions, we transform how we experience time, allowing us to appreciate and utilize the abundant moments we have effectively. Just as Seneca observed in ancient Rome, seeing time as a gift rather than a burden invites us to live more deliberately and fulfill our potential, enhancing our everyday lives with a sense of purpose and tranquility.
