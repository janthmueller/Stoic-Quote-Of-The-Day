Never praise or blame people on common grounds; look to their judgements exclusively. Because that is the determining factor, which makes everyone's actions either good or bad.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
The heart of Epictetus’ wisdom in this quote lies in understanding that true character is revealed through one’s judgments, rather than surface actions or circumstances. In everyday life, it's easy to get caught up in appearances and label people good or bad based on isolated actions or popular opinion. However, Stoicism urges us to look deeper, to examine the rationale and values guiding a person's decisions. For instance, consider a coworker who frequently disagrees with majority opinions during meetings. It might be tempting to label them as difficult or contrarian. Still, before passing judgment, it would be wise to explore their reasoning. Perhaps they have carefully considered perspectives that challenge the status quo to drive positive change within the company. On the flip side, someone who always seems agreeable and well-liked might not necessarily possess a sound moral compass. Their behavior might stem more from the desire to fit in than from well-considered values. By looking beyond actions to the underlying judgments, we align ourselves more closely with the Stoic principle of valuing wisdom and integrity over superficial measures, cultivating a more thoughtful and fair approach to understanding others.
