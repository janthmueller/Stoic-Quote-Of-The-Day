Similarly, man is born for deeds of kindness; and when he has done a kindly action, or otherwise served the common welfare, he has done what he was made for, and has received his quittance.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Engaging in acts of kindness and contributing to the welfare of others is a fulfillment of our natural purpose. Just as a tool works best when used for its intended design, we function most harmoniously when we act with compassion and service toward others. Imagine the satisfaction one might feel after helping a friend move, volunteering at a shelter, or even just offering a listening ear to someone in distress; these deeds are more than just acts—they resonate with our inherent human nature. In our often busy and self-focused lives, we sometimes forget how powerful and gratifying it can be to extend kindness. The true reward of such actions isn’t tangible but rather an internal sense of fulfillment, a sense of living in alignment with who we are supposed to be. This idea aligns with many contemporary values, such as community service and social responsibility. When we make others' lives better, we inadvertently enrich our own, creating a cycle of positivity that benefits everyone involved. Thus, living for kindness isn’t just a Stoic ideal but a practical way to ensure personal and communal well-being in today’s world.
