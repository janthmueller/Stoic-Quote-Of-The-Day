    <em>"Why need we weep over parts of our life? the whole of it calls for tears: new miseries assail us before we have freed ourselves from the old ones."</em><br>
    <strong>â€” Seneca</strong>
</p>

<p align="center" style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;">
    In life, challenges and difficulties often seem unending and overwhelming. Seneca's words draw attention to the fact that suffering is an inherent part of existence, as new difficulties arise even before we can fully recover from previous ones. This might at first seem disheartening, but there's a liberation in accepting that life's struggles are a shared human experience. For example, modern life can be a cycle of stressors, such as work pressures and personal losses, which appear relentless. By acknowledging that life in its entirety includes such inevitable hardships, you can cultivate resilience and find a steadier footing amid chaos. Rather than becoming consumed by sorrow over individual setbacks, consider developing an enduring perspective that sees these difficulties as part of a greater whole. Understanding that everyone faces continuous challenges can foster empathy, patience, and a sense of community, encouraging us to seek growth and meaning in the way we handle life's relentless waves.
