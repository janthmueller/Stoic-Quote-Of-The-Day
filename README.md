So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not Ill-supplied but wasteful of it.

Seneca reminds us that our lives, while finite, are often perceived as shorter not because of their duration but because of how we misuse our time. The key lies not in the quantity of time we have but in how we choose to spend it. Each day provides us with countless opportunities and moments brimming with potential, yet we often squander them on trivial pursuits or distractions. In contemporary society, this can be seen in how we obsess over social media, binge-watch shows out of habit, or engage in endless streams of superficial tasks, all the while convincing ourselves of being busy. These activities, though they may fill our days, often leave us feeling unfulfilled. By aligning our actions more closely with our true values and priorities, we can make our lives fuller and more meaningful. It's a call to invest our time wisely in activities that enrich our intellect, nurture our relationships, and serve a greater purpose. By doing so, we can transform each moment into something valuable and ensure that our lives feel not only long in years but also rich in quality and depth.
