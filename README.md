We ought frequently to remind ourselves that we must love the things of this life as we would what is shortly to leave us, or indeed in the very act of leaving us.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In this world where change is the only constant, we should cherish things—as if they are on the verge of slipping away—to cultivate a deeper appreciation for their temporary presence. Instead of anxiously clutching what we hold dear, we can embrace a mindset that fully acknowledges the impermanence of all life experiences. Picture the joy of savoring a sunset: knowing it will soon disappear makes its colors even more vibrant and cherished. Similarly, when sharing moments with loved ones, focusing on the thought that each interaction could be fleeting allows us to be truly present and grateful. This perspective encourages us to engage with life and its offerings—whether possessions, relationships, or opportunities—with gratitude that is not diminished by clinging but enhanced by the understanding that everything is fleeting. Applying this to our daily lives can turn ordinary events into extraordinary experiences, infusing them with a richness that transcends their physical continuity. By doing so, we shift from a fearful approach to a loving embracing of life’s ephemeral beauty.
