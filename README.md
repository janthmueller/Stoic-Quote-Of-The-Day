<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Spending a significant amount of time with certain habits, people, or environments can desensitize us to the nature—good or bad—of those influences. Just as we can grow to cherish and emulate positive traits through healthy relationships or constructive habits, we can unknowingly absorb negativity or harmful behaviors simply by being around them too often. In contemporary life, think of someone who surrounds themselves with friends who excel in kindness and generosity; over time, that person may develop those virtues predominantly and find real joy in them. Conversely, consider someone exposed continuously to gossip or deceit. What starts as discomfort may gradually become normal or even appealing, despite its ethical shortcomings. Recognizing how environments shape us emphasizes the importance of consciously choosing our surroundings and company to nurture the inclinations and values we wish to embody, ensuring we reinforce love for what elevates, not corrupts, our character.
