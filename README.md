Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In life, it's easy to fall into the habit of criticizing others, often without considering our own faults. Marcus Aurelius encourages us to take a reflective pause before we criticize, asking us to examine ourselves for similar flaws. This approach fosters empathy and understanding by reminding us that we, too, are imperfect. By acknowledging our own shortcomings, we create a space of humility that tempers judgment with kindness. For example, if a colleague misses a deadline, and your immediate reaction is to point out their disorganization, remember a time when you struggled with time management. This reflective practice not only softens our approach to others but also provides an opportunity for personal growth. It nurtures a more compassionate interaction, transforming criticism into an opportunity for connection, both with others and with our inner selves. By recognizing our shared humanity, we cultivate an environment of support rather than one of blame, making our relationships more harmonious and resilient.
