Remind thyself that he whom thou lovest is mortal  that what thou lovest is not thine own; it is given thee for the present, not irrevocably nor for ever, but even as a fig or a bunch of grapes at the appointed season of the year.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In the midst of our modern lives, where relationships and possessions often take on a sense of permanence, it's valuable to remember the transient nature of everything we hold dear. When we love someone deeply or treasure something dearly, there lies an implicit expectation of continuity—of having them or it indefinitely. Yet, the wisdom here encourages us to appreciate the present moment without clinging to the illusion of permanence. Just as we savor a ripe fig or a bunch of grapes when they are in season, we should cherish our loved ones with the understanding that life’s circumstances are ever-changing. This acceptance doesn't diminish the joy or love we feel, but rather enhances it, allowing us to be present and fully appreciative, without the fear of inevitable change or loss overshadowing our experience. In contemporary terms, it can be likened to enjoying a sunset; we know it won't last forever, yet its beauty is no less compelling. By acknowledging the impermanence of life, we free ourselves from the burden of clutching onto things beyond their time, and in doing so, find a deeper, more peaceful appreciation for them while they are with us.
