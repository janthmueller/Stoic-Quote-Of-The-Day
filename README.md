In our fast-paced world, it’s often easier to stick with familiar beliefs rather than take the time to critically evaluate new information. Seneca’s observation reflects a timeless human tendency to shy away from the effort and discomfort that come with questioning our assumptions. For example, take the proliferation of social media where opinions and ideas are rapidly shared and consumed. Many people might scroll through their feeds, absorbing information at face value because it aligns with their existing views, rather than scrutinizing the validity of these claims. This behavior offers immediate comfort and confirmation, reinforcing what we already think we know. The exercise of judgment, however, requires us to pause, reflect, and sometimes confront the unsettling reality that we might have been wrong. This effort is the cornerstone of a thoughtful life, encouraging growth and understanding beyond the bounds of our immediate intuitions. By actively engaging with different perspectives and challenging our preconceptions, we cultivate the wisdom necessary to navigate the complex world around us with integrity and openness. In doing so, we honor the stoic ideal of a life guided not by the blind acceptance of belief, but by deliberate and reasoned judgment.
