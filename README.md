That to expect bad people not to injure others is crazy. It's to ask the impossible. And to let them behave like that to other people but expect them to exempt you is arrogant--the act of a tyrant.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
It is unrealistic to believe that people who engage in harmful behavior will suddenly stop doing so out of consideration for others, and especially naive to assume they would make an exception for you. This perspective encourages a humble acknowledgment that the world contains individuals who will act hurtfully because it is within their nature or circumstances, and it is simply impractical to think they would alter their behavior under our expectations. When someone acts negatively, like a colleague who consistently undermines others to get ahead, hoping they will not do the same to you just because of who you are is not only misguided but stems from a place of unwarranted pride. It is like assuming the sun won’t shine as brightly on you because you find its heat uncomfortable. Instead, understanding human behavior’s predictability can aid us in preparing for and responding to such situations without outrage. It reminds us to maintain realistic expectations about others while ensuring our actions and responses align with our values, not the whims of those who might wrong us. This mindset helps us focus less on hoping others will change in ways they might not and more on how we can adapt circumstances to align with our principles, finding peace and resilience in the process.
