Another does wrong. What is that to me? Let him look to it; he has his own disposition, his own activity. I have now what Universal Nature wills me to have, and I do what my own nature wills me to do.

When faced with the wrongdoings of others, it's essential to recognize that how they behave is a reflection of their own character and not something that directly affects or defines us. Each person possesses their own set of values and decisions, shaped by their unique experiences and internal compass. In the same way that someone else's storm doesn't disrupt the calmness of the inner sea, the wrongs others commit are theirs to navigate and rectify. Our focus should remain on what is within our control: our actions, our responses, and our personal growth. This philosophy encourages us to maintain a sense of inner peace and purpose, dictated by our own values. In today's world, for example, we might encounter someone being unfair or disrespectful at work. While it is natural to feel impacted initially, Stoicism teaches us to step back and realize that their actions are a reflection of their state, not ours. Our true power lies in how we choose to respond, focusing on maintaining integrity and peace within ourselves, and allowing others to deal with the consequences of their behavior. By anchoring ourselves to what we can control, we live harmoniously with the natural order of things, accepting that everyone is responsible for their own path.
