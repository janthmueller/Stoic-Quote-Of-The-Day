For a man cannot lose either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him?

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Marcus Aurelius reminds us that we cannot lose the past or the future because they are not possessions to be taken away. The past is a collection of experiences that have already happened and cannot be altered or reclaimed, much like a series of completed chapters in a book. Obsessing over what has occurred only traps us in a cycle of regret or nostalgia. Similarly, the future is merely a concept, a collection of possibilities that have yet to unfold. Worrying about what might happen robs us of our peace in the present moment. By recognizing that neither the past nor the future truly belongs to us, we are freed from the anxiety of losing something intangible. In everyday life, this perspective translates to focusing on what we can control: the present moment. For instance, if you're anxious about a job interview next week or ruminating over a conversation from last month, recognize that the power lies in how you prepare now and how you choose to respond today. By grounding ourselves in the present, we cultivate a mindset of acceptance and clarity, allowing us to act wisely and genuinely in every moment.
