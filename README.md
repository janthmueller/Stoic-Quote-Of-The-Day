Life is as unpredictable as a bird in flight, never pausing and always moving forward. This gentle reminder from Seneca focuses on the transient nature of time, urging us to be mindful of how we spend each moment. In our modern, busy lives filled with endless notifications, meetings, and responsibilities, it’s easy to lose track of time. Hours can slip by unnoticed as we scroll through social media or binge-watch another episode of our favorite show. Seneca invites us to consider what truly matters and invest our energy in pursuits that enrich our lives rather than merely filling the time. Embracing the unpredictability of time also means accepting that we can’t control everything and that not every moment will go as planned. By staying present and aligning our actions with our values, we can ensure that as time flies by, we are living authentically and meaningfully, making the most of the moments we do have.
