Then consider the Middle (and later the New) Comedy and what it aimed at—gradually degenerating into mere realism and empty technique.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
The observation highlights how the pursuit of art can sometimes devolve from inspiring, purposeful expression into something mundane and superficial. In the context of Marcus Aurelius’ time, the Middle and New Comedy began as a reflection of human experiences and emotions, intended to prompt reflection and growth. Over time, however, such art risked becoming more focused on trivial and everyday concerns, driven by technique devoid of deeper meaning or insight. This parallels situations in contemporary life where initial enthusiasm or noble intent in any field can eventually decline into routine or mere formality. For example, consider a company that starts with the passion of innovating and improving lives, only to find itself later driven by profit margins and procedural efficiency, losing sight of its original mission. It serves as a reminder to infuse our activities—not just in artistic pursuits but in all endeavors—with genuine purpose and to avoid becoming ensnared in the surface-level trappings of technique without intention. In our personal and professional lives, maintaining focus on deeper values and aspirations ensures that our actions remain meaningful and impactful rather than becoming simply a hollow imitation of past authenticity.
