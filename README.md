Destroy desire completely for the present. For if you desire anything which is not in our power, you must be unfortunate.

Epictetus reminds us to focus on what is within our control and let go of desires for things beyond our grasp, for allowing such desires can lead to frustration and unhappiness. Imagine you long for a promotion at work; the immediate urge might be to fixate on obtaining that coveted position. However, the decision to promote you is ultimately out of your hands, reliant on factors like company needs or management decisions. Instead, shift your focus to what you can control: improving your skills, consistently delivering quality work, and cultivating professional relationships. By aligning your desires with actions within your power, you reduce the risk of disappointment and maintain your peace of mind. This approach of minimizing desire for external outcomes can similarly apply to various aspects of life, whether it be a sought-after relationship, a dream home, or even a perfectly planned vacation. Accepting that complete control is an illusion frees you from the strain of unmet desires, allowing you to appreciate the present and act with intention on things you truly can influence.
