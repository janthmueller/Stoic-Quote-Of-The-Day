The greatest loss of time is delay and expectation, which depend upon the future. We let go the present, which we have in our power, and look forward to that which depends upon chance, and so relinquish a certainty for an uncertainty.

Seneca's insight highlights how much of our precious time slips away as we dwell on the uncertain future, losing sight of the present moment, which is the only time truly within our grasp. Imagine the hours spent daydreaming about tomorrow’s success or worrying over potential failures; this tendency to delay action or pin hopes solely on what might happen leads us astray from the opportunities at hand. In a contemporary setting, consider how often people postpone pursuing a passion due to fears or insist on waiting for the "right time" to start a new venture or relationship. Yet, life unfolds in the now, and delaying action only serves to cede control to whims of chance. By shifting focus from what-ifs to immediate actions—whether making a phone call today to mend a relationship or finally starting that creative project languishing in your mind—we can make the most of the present. Trusting too heavily in future promises can breed missed opportunities, but embracing what you can do right now empowers you to shape your path with tangible steps, reducing the time wasted on hypothetical scenarios.
