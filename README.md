Pain is slight if opinion has added nothing to it; ... in thinking it slight, you will make it slight. Everything depends on opinion. It is according to opinion that we suffer. A man is as wretched as he has convinced himself that he is.

Seneca is highlighting the powerful role our mindset plays in shaping our experiences, particularly our perception of pain. In modern life, we often encounter challenges—whether they're stressful work deadlines, arguments with loved ones, or unexpected setbacks—that may initially seem overwhelming or distressing. However, it's important to recognize that these experiences often become more intense due to the narratives we create about them in our minds. If we allow ourselves to dwell on negativity or exaggerate difficulties, they indeed become heavier burdens to carry. On the other hand, by actively choosing to view situations with a sense of perspective and calm, the discomfort they cause can be significantly reduced. For example, a busy day at work might feel like an insurmountable pressure, but by reprioritizing tasks and focusing on what can be accomplished rather than fixating on the volume of work, the stress can diminish substantially. Similarly, after a disagreement with a friend, concentrating on the friendship's positive aspects and the motivation for understanding rather than conflict can ease emotional turmoil. Ultimately, Seneca reminds us that our disposition largely dictates our emotional experience, illustrating the transformative power of approaching life with a mindset that frames challenges as manageable rather than overwhelming.
