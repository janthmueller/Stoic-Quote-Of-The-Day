Would you rather be poor and sated, or rich and hungry? Prosperity is not only greedy, but it also lies exposed to the greed of others. And as long as nothing satisfies you, you yourself cannot satisfy others.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In Seneca's reflection, he prompts us to consider the essence of true contentment beyond material wealth. Imagine you have all the riches in the world but constantly crave more; like a feast that never touches your hunger, this insatiable yearning leaves you unfulfilled and vulnerable. Prosperity, while seemingly desirable, weaves a complex web of greed—not just within yourself—as you seek endlessly for more—but also from others, who might covet what you possess. In a modern context, this might look like someone who spends their life climbing the corporate ladder, only to find that each promotion brings more stress and less satisfaction. On the other hand, envision a modest life where one's needs are met, and their heart is full. A person content in their own skin, cherishing what they have, can more effortlessly extend warmth and generosity to those around them. They have no need to fear the desires of others because they themselves are grounded in true fulfillment. Fulfillment, therefore, is a state of being that comes from appreciating the present and being at peace with ourselves, regardless of our external circumstances.
