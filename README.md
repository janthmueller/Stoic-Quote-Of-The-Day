But fortunate means that a man has assigned to himself a good fortune: and a good fortune is good disposition of the soul, good emotions, good actions.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Marc Aurelius suggests that true fortune is not measured by material wealth or external success, but rather by the internal state of our soul. He defines a good fortune as having a positive disposition, which encompasses cultivating inner virtues, maintaining good emotions, and engaging in good actions. In our modern day, this can translate into the way we handle life's challenges. Instead of solely seeking external markers of success—such as promotions, luxury goods, or social validation—happiness and fulfillment arise from within. Imagine someone who loses their job, a situation that might traditionally spell misfortune. If that person possesses a resilient spirit, a positive outlook, and engages in constructive behaviors like learning new skills or volunteering, they essentially create their own good fortune. According to Stoic philosophy, when we nurture our character and strive for peace of mind, we remain in control of our well-being irrespective of external circumstances. The soul, through its unwavering strength and virtue, becomes the true barometer of fortune, ensuring that no storm of life can rob us of our serenity or contentment.
