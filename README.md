In no great while you will be no one and nowhere, and nothing that you now behold will be in existence, nor will anyone now alive. For it is in the nature of all things to change and alter and perish, so that others may arise in their turn.

In our fast-paced world, it's easy to forget that much of what occupies our time and concerns us deeply is temporary. This passage by Marcus Aurelius gently nudges us to reflect on the transitory nature of life and existence. Think of your daily commute through a bustling city; skyscrapers standing tall, people rushing by, absorbed in their lives. Yet, history shows us that even the most solid-looking structures erode over time, and the people will, in the grand timeline of the universe, soon also fade away. This isn't a call to despair, but rather an invitation to appreciate the present moment and understand that change is inevitable. Just as an old tree falls to nourish the earth for new growth, we too play our part in a cycle that renews continually. In recognizing that nothing remains the same forever, we can find solace and motivation to embrace life’s moments as they come, knowing they make way for what is to come. By accepting the ebb and flow of existence, we free ourselves from the anxiety of trying to control the fleeting passage of time and instead focus on living meaningfully, fostering connections, and contributing positively to the lives around us.
