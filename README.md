I was once a fortunate man but at some point fortune abandoned me. But true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, and good actions.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In life, we often find ourselves swaying in the winds of fate, celebrating when luck seems to be on our side and lamenting when it turns. Marcus Aurelius gently reminds us that what we often perceive as fortune—external circumstances like success, wealth, or even recognition—can be fleeting. Instead, he emphasizes the enduring nature of the fortune we cultivate within ourselves. True good fortune isn't tied to external achievements but is rooted in the development of our inner character. When we focus on nurturing good character, harboring noble intentions, and engaging in right actions, we create a stable foundation that no change of external circumstance can easily shake. In contemporary life, this could mean choosing integrity over shortcuts in one’s career, or showing kindness and understanding to those around us, regardless of their responses. These choices build a fortune of resilience and fulfillment that outlasts the temporary highs and lows of external success. By aligning our actions with our values, we create a lasting sense of satisfaction and peace, crafting our own unwavering fortune that abides amidst the ever-changing tides of life.
