Epictetus reminds us of the importance of focusing on what we can truly control in life: our choices. In a world full of uncertainties and events beyond our grasp, our power lies in what we choose to pursue or avoid. Imagine you're at work facing criticism. Instead of reacting emotionally or defensively, reflect with discipline and calm. Choose how you will respond, whether by taking constructive feedback or by not internalizing negativity. This deliberate practice of making thoughtful decisions extends to all aspects of life, whether it's choosing to nurture healthy relationships or deciding to let go of toxic ones. It's about understanding that while we cannot dictate everything that happens, we do command how we respond. By practicing detachment, we acknowledge that our inner peace shouldn't be influenced by external factors. This mindset doesn't equate to indifference; rather, it is about approaching situations thoughtfully and with equilibrium, ensuring that our actions align with our true values and long-term wellbeing.
