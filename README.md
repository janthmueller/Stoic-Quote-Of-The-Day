<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
When we engage in teaching others, we often discover that we expand our own understanding in the process. By articulating our knowledge, we are compelled to organize our thoughts and clarify concepts that may have been vague or assumed. Picture a situation where a person has grasped a new skill at work—perhaps understanding a complex software. As they guide a colleague through its functions, they might encounter questions that challenge their assumptions, encouraging them to think critically and explore deeper nuances they hadn’t considered before. During this exchange, the teacher refines their comprehension and may even uncover gaps that urge them to learn further. This two-way flow enhances their initial grasp and strengthens their mastery over the subject. Whether it's a parent explaining math homework, a coach guiding young athletes, or anyone sharing what they know, the process of teaching turns into a reflective journey. It reminds us that knowledge is not stagnant, but rather it evolves with interaction and open dialogue, rooted in the ancient wisdom that those who teach often learn themselves.
