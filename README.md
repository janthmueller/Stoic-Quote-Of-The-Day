When you are feeling upset, angry, or sad, don’t blame another for your state of mind. Your condition is the result of your own opinions and interpretations.

Epictetus reminds us of the power we hold over our emotional responses, illustrating how our perception of events, rather than the events themselves, shapes our mood and state of mind. In our daily lives, this might manifest when you find yourself stuck in traffic on a busy morning, feeling a surge of frustration. It might be tempting to blame the slow drivers or the city's infrastructure for making you late. However, the Stoic perspective encourages us to reflect on how we are interpreting the situation. Instead of letting anger brew over things beyond our control, we can choose to see the delay as an opportunity to listen to a favorite podcast or simply practice patience. Our reactions are not mere consequences of external events but are deeply tied to the narratives we create in our minds. By recognizing that we have the ability to shift our perspectives, we reclaim a sense of peace and agency, preventing negative emotions from overpowering our rationality or outlook on life. Embracing this mindset fosters resilience, transforming life's inevitable frustrations into moments of personal growth and understanding.
