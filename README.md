Let us be brave in the face of hazards. Let us not fear wrongs, or wounds, or bonds, or poverty. And what is death? It is either the end, or a process of change.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Seneca encourages embracing courage when faced with life's uncertainties and misfortunes, rather than letting fear dictate our actions. In everyday life, this could mean tackling workplace challenges without fear of failure, taking bold steps in relationships despite the chance of heartbreak, or adapting to financial instability with resourcefulness. By reminding us that even death is merely an end or a transition, Seneca offers a perspective that liberates us from the paralyzing grip of fear. When we accept that all hazards—whether they be physical injuries, unjust actions, or economic struggles—are part of the human experience, we can approach each situation with resilience and clarity. Ultimately, recognizing that many fears are largely self-imposed helps us focus on what truly matters: living with integrity and acceptance of the natural course of life. Through this mindset, we find strength not only to endure life's tests but to appreciate the meaningful moments along the way.
