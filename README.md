Let not the future trouble you; for you will come to it, if come you must, bearing with you the same reason which you are using now to meet the present.

When faced with the uncertainties of the future, it's essential to focus on the present moment, trusting in your current ability to reason and deal with challenges. Marcus Aurelius reminds us that worrying excessively about what might happen can lead to unnecessary stress, distracting us from addressing the tasks at hand. Much like preparing for an important meeting or presentation, the key is to apply the skills and knowledge you possess now rather than getting tangled up in hypothetical outcomes. Just as in preparing, you wouldn't spend all your energy imagining various scenarios that might derail your presentation. Instead, you would focus on evaluating your current tools, such as your presentation skills, content understanding, and ability to adapt, knowing you can rely on them in real-time as situations arise. By having confidence in our present wisdom and capability, we create a more stable and less anxious path forward, equipped with the same rational thinking that serves us well in the here and now.
