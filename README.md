Here are thieves and robbers and tribunals: and they that are called tyrants, who deem that they have after a fashion power over us, because of the miserable body and what appertains to it. Let us show them that they have power over none.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In our modern world, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by external forces that seem to control aspects of our lives—whether it's demanding bosses, government regulations, or societal pressures. This ancient insight from Epictetus encourages us to recognize that true power lies not in these external influences but within our own minds and choices. The "thieves and robbers" of today could manifest as negative opinions or toxic work environments that seem to dictate our emotions and self-worth. Similarly, "tyrants" might be those individuals or systems that appear to dictate our circumstances, often linked to material possessions or social status. By understanding that these external entities primarily affect our physical circumstances rather than our inner selves, we reclaim control. In essence, they can only hold power over what is unimportant—fleeting possessions or temporary situations—because our true freedom resides in our ability to choose our responses and maintain our moral integrity. When confronted with daily stressors or perceived injustices, remembering that no one can truly dominate our inner peace reminds us of the perennial strength and autonomy we possess, regardless of the external chaos.
