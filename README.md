<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Seneca's wisdom reminds us that the things we gain through luck, rather than our own efforts, are not ours to truly claim. In today's world, this could mean that a sudden financial windfall, perhaps winning a lottery or receiving an unexpected inheritance, while certainly a blessing, is not something deeply rooted in our own merit or endeavor. This perspective encourages us to detach our identity and sense of worth from these external, chance-based acquisitions. Instead, we should focus on cultivating qualities and skills that are earned through perseverance, like building meaningful relationships, developing moral character, or honing professional skills. Just as fleeting trends and passing popularity shouldn't define our self-esteem, neither should the unpredictable turns of fortune. By understanding that these chance occurrences are not the essence of who we are, we can approach life with balance, appreciating fortuitous events when they come, but not allowing them to sway the core of our identity or values.
