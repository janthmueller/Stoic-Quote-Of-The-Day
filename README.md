    <em>"because it is natural to touch more often the parts that hurt."</em><br>
    <strong>— Seneca</strong>
</p>

<p align="center" style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;">
    When Seneca observes that we tend to touch the parts that hurt, he is highlighting a natural human tendency to focus on our problems or pain, both physically and emotionally. In our daily lives, when something bothers us—be it a minor inconvenience or a significant life issue—we often dwell on it, continually examining it in our minds just like we might press a bruise with our fingers. This is natural, reflecting our desire to understand or alleviate discomfort. However, while attention to pain can help identify solutions, excessive fixation can amplify distress and hinder recovery. For instance, when facing work-related stress, it’s common to replay negative interactions or anticipate future frustrations. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed, as our mental energy becomes consumed by things outside our immediate control. Seneca’s insight gently reminds us that while it's instinctive to attend to what's hurting, it's equally important to balance this inclination by stepping back occasionally, allowing ourselves to focus on what is going well, and to cultivate resilience by engaging with life's broader, positive aspects. Embracing a stoic approach would mean recognizing this tendency and, rather than getting caught up in a cycle of rumination, consciously shifting focus towards constructive actions and thoughts that restore peace and clarity.
