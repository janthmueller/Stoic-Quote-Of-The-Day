Time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.

Life provides each of us with a finite amount of time, urging us to use it meaningfully to clear mental clutter and seek clarity of thought. Imagine waking up each day with a set number of hours to navigate through life's complexities. If we choose to ignore the mental clouds—such as worries, distractions, or misunderstandings—we allow this valuable time to slip away irretrievably. In today's fast-paced world, we are surrounded by countless sources of noise, from social media notifications to everyday stressors, all vying for our attention. By actively engaging in self-reflection, mindfulness, or deliberate learning, we can cut through this mental fog. Just as someone might allocate a few minutes daily to meditate or journal, these practices clear the mind, bringing focus to what truly matters. Once a day passes, we cannot reclaim it, much like a river that flows endlessly forward. Thus, utilizing our time to cultivate wisdom and tranquility not only enriches our current moments but also shapes a brighter, more intentional future.
