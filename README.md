If you find something very difficult to achieve yourself, don’t imagine it impossible—for anything possible and proper for another person can be achieved as easily by you.

Marcus Aurelius encourages us to shift our perspective when confronted with challenges, urging us to see the potential within ourselves by recognizing that we are just as capable as anyone else who has succeeded in similar endeavors. This Stoic perspective is particularly relevant in today's world, where we often compare ourselves with others who seem to achieve great feats effortlessly. Whether it's learning a new skill, landing a dream job, or fostering meaningful relationships, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by our perceived limitations. However, Marcus Aurelius reminds us that if something is achievable by another human being, it is within our reach, too, provided it is within the realm of our strength and ability. This isn't merely about blind optimism; it's about understanding that perseverance, patience, and practice are the genuine levers of success. Much like witnessing a colleague excel in their career or a friend train for a marathon, imagine these as not markers of what one person can do but what humanity, including you, is capable of achieving. By focusing on continuous growth and our capacity for improvement, we can convert seemingly daunting tasks into tangible goals, fortified by the belief that our potential is just as vast as the best efforts of others. Embracing this mindset allows us to see barriers not as impenetrable walls but as hurdles to be leaped over with discipline and determination.
