Why do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is that you have long been labouring under? Take my word for it: since the day you were born you are being led thither.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Acknowledging the inevitability of fate is a reminder to embrace the journey of life with awareness and acceptance rather than denial. From the moment of birth, life's path, with all its trials and destinations, unfolds naturally and often beyond our control. Instead of spending energy deceiving ourselves about the nature of our existence or living in a state of surprise and resistance when faced with challenging realities, we can choose to understand and accept the course of life as it is. In the modern world, this idea resonates when we encounter circumstances we cannot change, such as aging, life's unpredictability, or changes we didn't foresee. By recognizing that these are innate parts of our life's trajectory, we can focus on how we respond rather than wishing reality were different. Embracing this perspective allows for greater peace and resilience, helping us to live more mindfully and with intentionality, recognizing each moment as part of our unique journey.
