<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
We often find ourselves lamenting the brevity of life, feeling rushed or overwhelmed as if time is slipping through our fingers. However, Seneca suggests that the real issue isn't how short life is, but rather how much of it we squander. In today's world, filled with countless distractions like social media, streaming services, and constant notifications, it's easy to lose track of time on activities that provide little lasting value. We spend hours scrolling through feeds or binging the latest series, only to find ourselves wondering where the day went. Seneca invites us to reflect on how we allocate our precious time. Instead of frittering it away, we could focus on meaningful pursuits, like nurturing relationships, learning new skills, or engaging in activities that align with our deeper values and goals. By being mindful of how we spend our time, we can make the most of our days, no matter their number, finding fulfillment and deeper satisfaction along the way.
