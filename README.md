Why do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is that you have long been labouring under? Take my word for it: since the day you were born you are being led thither.

Life is often compared to a journey, one where the destination isn't entirely clear to us from the onset. Seneca urges us to face this reality rather than deceiving ourselves into believing we have total control or can avoid certain outcomes. From the day we are born, we are carried along a current, often shaped by forces beyond our control—be that societal expectations, familial influences, or our own fortunes and misfortunes. Recognizing that we are on this path, instead of resisting it or feigning ignorance, allows us to engage with life more openly. The Stoic perspective invites us to accept the uncertainties and the inevitability of certain aspects of our journey. In contemporary life, we often labor under the misconception that we can dictate every direction. When career ambitions or personal relationships don't unfold as planned, we are surprised by the divergence from our expectations. Embracing the idea that we're part of a larger flow can enable us to meet life's turns with grace and adaptability rather than frustration. This acceptance empowers us to make mindful choices within the circumstances we find ourselves, understanding that while we navigate our own actions, the broader journey isn't ours to dictate entirely.
