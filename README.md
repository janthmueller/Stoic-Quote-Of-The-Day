Marcus Aurelius reminds us that there is no perfect timing except the timing you decide upon. In our fast-paced world, it’s easy to feel pressured by deadlines or the success stories of others, leaving us anxious about whether we’re ahead or falling behind. The Stoic perspective encourages us to trust the timing of our journey. Choosing to start a new career later in life, for example, might raise eyebrows in a society obsessed with youth, but, according to Stoicism, it can be exactly the right moment because it is your moment, informed by your experiences and readiness. Similarly, ending a relationship or moving to a new city might feel daunting, especially when society suggests a more conventional timeline. Yet Aurelius invites us to recognize our autonomy to define the best timing for these decisions based on our personal sense of readiness and understanding. This approach not only alleviates the unnecessary stress of conforming to arbitrary timelines but also empowers us to live authentically, trusting that our decisions align with our own path.
