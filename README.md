Things of themselves cannot touch the soul at all. They have no entry to the soul, and cannot turn or move it. The soul alone turns and moves itself, making all externals presented to it cohere with the judgements it thinks worthy of itself.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In a world bustling with distractions and challenges, it's crucial to recognize that external circumstances cannot deeply affect the core of who you truly are—your soul. Imagine facing a busy workday or dealing with unexpected car trouble; while these events may provoke stress, they don't dictate the essence of your being. When Marcus Aurelius speaks of the soul turning and moving itself, he highlights our intrinsic power to choose our responses and form our judgments. Just as a serene lake remains undisturbed by the myriad of activities around it, our inner self holds the power to remain calm and composed, interpreting external events thoughtfully and maturely. By doing so, we align these occurrences with the values and principles we cherish most deeply. Practicing this perspective means cultivating an internal resilience where daily frustrations, like a delayed flight or a disagreement with a friend, serve not as threats to our tranquility, but as opportunities to reflect, adapt, and reaffirm our most virtuous self.
