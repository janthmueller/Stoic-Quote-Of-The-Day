Unbroken prosperity cannot bear a single blow; but he who has waged an unceasing strife with his misfortunes has gained a thicker skin by his sufferings, yields to no disaster, and even though he fall yet fights on his knee.

Life's continuous successes can make us fragile, as they can lead us to believe that we are invincible or immune to hardship. When challenges inevitably arise, those unaccustomed to adversity might find themselves paralyzed or utterly undone by a single setback. Conversely, those who've faced and endured life's trials develop resilience and toughness, akin to a skin made thicker by experiences. Such individuals learn not just to withstand adversity but to adapt and grow stronger from it. Consider someone who has consistently faced financial hardships; each setback teaches them new skills and coping mechanisms, rendering them more capable and resourceful. Even if they stumble again, they face situations with resolve, ready to rise despite being knocked down. This perspective is crucial in today's fast-paced world, where uncertainty is a constant companion. Building resilience through life's challenges not only prepares us to deal with future obstacles but also transforms each misfortune into an opportunity for development. In essence, life’s challenges shape a formidable spirit that stands unwavering, not because it doesn’t fall but because it rises each time, undeterred.
