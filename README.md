Different reasons roused different peoples to leave their homes; but this at least is clear, nothing has stayed where it was born. The human race is always on the move.

Seneca’s reflection on the ceaseless movement of people underscores a fundamental aspect of human existence: change and migration are constants in life. Throughout history, people have traveled for various reasons—seeking safety, better opportunities, or simply the allure of new experiences. Today, this can be seen in how individuals often relocate for jobs, education, or personal growth. Just as ancient travelers packed their belongings to seek new horizons, we too venture outward, stimulated by the promise of what lies elsewhere. This perennial state of movement highlights the resilience and adaptability of the human spirit, urging us to embrace change with open hearts. While change can be daunting, it also opens doors to growth and self-discovery, a reminder that staying where one was born is not a necessity; rather, it is the courage to move toward the unknown that often propels us forward. In essence, life's journey is about embracing transformation and acknowledging that not only is physical movement inevitable, but so too is personal evolution.
