Poverty will keep for you your true and tried friends; you will be rid of the men who were not seeking you for yourself, but for something which you have.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Poverty can act as a revealing force in our lives, stripping away superficial connections and leaving us with those who truly value us for who we are, not for what we possess. When we face challenging times financially, the people who are only interested in material gain or status tend to drift away, seeking out relationships elsewhere that can provide them with the benefits they desire. Conversely, true friends do not measure the value of a relationship by one's wealth or social standing, but rather by the genuine connection and mutual support shared. In today's society, where it is easy to become entangled in networks driven by status symbols, such as cars, homes, or designer clothing, the essence of authentic friendship can sometimes get lost. Yet, when the veneer of prosperity fades away, those who remain by our side—ready to offer support, share both joy and sorrow, and continue their companionship—are the ones who prove to be invaluable. These are the relationships that enrich our lives, unshackled by material conditions, and it is often through the lens of adversity that we learn who our "true and tried" friends really are.
