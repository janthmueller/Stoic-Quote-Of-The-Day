This evil of taking our cue from others has become so deeply ingrained that even that most basic feeling, grief, degenerates into imitation.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In today's world, many of us unknowingly take our emotional cues from those around us, which Seneca warns against by highlighting how even something as personal as grief can become an imitation instead of an authentic experience. Consider the way social media amplifies shared reactions, often shaping how we believe we should respond to certain events. When a celebrity passes away, for instance, we might feel pressured to exhibit a level of sorrow visible across our newsfeeds, not necessarily because it's our genuine response, but because it's the popular one. This doesn't mean that shared experiences or collective empathy are wrong, but Seneca encourages us to look inward and discern our true feelings from those we are pushed to adopt by external influences. By cultivating this inner awareness, we can honor our authentic emotions and prevent them from being overshadowed or replaced by society's expectations. In doing so, we find a sense of personal truth and integrity, distinguishing what is sincerely ours from what is merely borrowed from others—a timeless practice that helps us remain genuine amidst the noise of the world.
