Here is your great soul—the man who has given himself over to Fate; on the other hand, that man is a weakling and a degenerate who struggles and maligns the order of the universe and would rather reform the gods than reform himself.

In Seneca’s perspective, a truly great soul is one that embraces the course of events as they unfold, understanding that there are many aspects of life that lie beyond our control. This acceptance, rather than resignation, brings a profound sense of inner strength and peace. The person who aligns with the natural order finds harmony, knowing that fighting against what is or should be is futile. In contrast, someone who constantly battles against reality—who blames the cosmos for their troubles and refuses to adapt or grow—is seen as weak and misguided. Instead of blaming external forces or desiring to change immutable circumstances, the path to strength and resilience lies in self-improvement and acceptance. In today’s world, we might see this in how we handle disappointments or setbacks. Imagine dealing with a sudden job loss or a relationship ending. Instead of railing against destiny or blaming others, a Stoic mindset encourages us to focus on what can be learned from the experience and on how we can adapt and improve ourselves. Embracing change and fostering inner growth leads to a more fulfilling life, anchored in peace, regardless of external turbulence. This philosophy of adapting rather than resisting offers a way to build resilience in navigating life's inevitable ups and downs.
