That way you'll see human life for what it is. Smoke. Nothing. Especially when you recall that once things alter they cease to exist through all the endless years to come. Then why such turmoil?

Life, according to Marcus Aurelius, can be seen as transient and insubstantial, like a wisp of smoke that momentarily appears before disappearing. The understanding that all things are temporary and constantly changing helps us realize that much of our daily turmoil and anxiety stems from attaching too much significance to what is inherently fleeting. Imagine worrying endlessly about a minor disappointment at work or the fleeting embarrassment from a social faux pas. Just as a plume of smoke dissipates in the air, these moments, too, will soon dissolve into the past, leaving no lasting mark. By keeping in mind that everything around us, including our own experiences, is part of an ever-shifting current of change, we can cultivate a sense of serenity. This awareness empowers us to focus on what truly matters: living virtuously, being present, and embracing the impermanent nature of life. When we relinquish our struggles over things we cannot control and acknowledge their impermanence, we free ourselves from unnecessary distress, allowing us to lead a more peaceful, fulfilling existence.
