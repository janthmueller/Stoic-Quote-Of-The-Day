And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Embodying the wisdom of Socrates, Marcus Aurelius highlights the importance of balance and self-control in our lives. It's about cultivating the strength to either abstain from or partake in life's pleasures without losing oneself. Imagine the temptation of a rich dessert or the allure of a weekend celebration; while there's nothing inherently wrong with enjoying them, it's crucial to practice moderation. Many people find themselves either overindulging or completely avoiding certain activities because they lack the ability to engage moderately. True freedom and strength come from being able to enjoy life’s pleasures with mindfulness, avoiding the trap of excess while not denying oneself joy. This can also apply to our emotional landscape: enjoying success without arrogance or accepting setbacks without despair. It’s a call to live harmoniously, mastering desires rather than being mastered by them, allowing us to fully appreciate what we have without the complications of excess. By adopting this balanced approach, we cultivate a life free from the turmoil of extremes, rooted in a steadiness that enhances our experience of the world.
