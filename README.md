The fencer’s weapon is picked up and put down again. The boxer’s is part of him. All he has to do is clench his fist.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In our daily lives, much like in the distinction between a fencer and a boxer as described by Marcus Aurelius, we are reminded of the importance of internalizing our strengths and virtues. The fencer relies on an external tool, which can be picked up or set aside depending on the situation, suggesting a reliance on things outside oneself that are not always under our control. Conversely, the boxer embodies his tool; his fists are a natural extension of who he is, reflecting an inherent readiness and adaptability that require no additional preparation or reliance on external factors. This idea is particularly relevant today when considering how we approach challenges in work or personal growth. In a job, for example, relying solely on software or tools outside oneself, like a fencer depends on his weapon, might make us vulnerable if those tools are suddenly unavailable. Instead, cultivating intrinsic skills—such as creativity, critical thinking, and resilience—mirrors the boxer's natural readiness. These are internal strengths that cannot be lost or taken away, enabling us to adapt and thrive regardless of circumstances. Embracing this stoic wisdom encourages us to develop and rely on our inherent attributes as our true armaments in navigating the complexities of modern life.
