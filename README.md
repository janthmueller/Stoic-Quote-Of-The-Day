    <em>"Ab honesto virum bonum nihil deterret. (Nothing deters a good man from doing what is honorable.)-A Wrinkle in Time."</em><br>
    <strong>â€” Seneca</strong>
</p>

<p align="center" style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;">
    A good person is defined by their unwavering commitment to integrity and doing what is honorable, no matter the challenges they face. This steadfastness comes from understanding that true fulfillment and peace of mind stem from acting in accordance with one's values, instead of succumbing to external pressures, fear, or inconvenience. In modern life, think about a professional who chooses not to engage in unethical practices at work even if it means losing out on promotions or praise. Or consider someone in their social circle standing up for a friend facing injustice, despite potential backlash or criticism from others. These examples highlight a core Stoic belief that a virtuous individual remains anchored in their principles, guided by a deep inner conviction, and is willing to confront discomfort or adversity to maintain their moral integrity. This pursuit of what is right over what is easy or advantageous propels one towards a life marked by authenticity and true moral courage.
