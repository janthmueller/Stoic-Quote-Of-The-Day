<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Life has a way of offering both smooth and rough patches, and Seneca reminds us of the wisdom in using periods of calm and prosperity as opportunities for inner growth and preparation for future challenges. Just like athletes train intensively during the off-season to build resilience and skill for the competitive months, we too should fortify our spirit during peaceful times. In modern life, you might consider using moments of stability to develop emotional intelligence, acquire new skills, save resources, and nurture relationships, so that when life's inevitable storms arise, you are equipped to handle them with grace and sturdiness. It is easy to become complacent when things are going well, but mental and emotional preparation during these times builds the resilience needed to confront hardship with courage. Just as a strong foundation supports a house through a storm, so does a well-prepared spirit support a person through life's unpredictabilities.
