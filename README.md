    <em>"We should put our trust not in the crowd, who say that only free men can be educated, but rather in the philosophers, who say that none but the educated can be free."</em><br>
    <strong>— Epictetus</strong>

    True freedom comes not from external circumstances, but from the internal liberation that knowledge and understanding provide. In modern society, it's easy to confine the idea of education to formal schooling, yet a deeper education lies in the continuous quest for wisdom and self-improvement. Epictetus suggests that rather than being swayed by popular opinion—that only those with tangible freedom have the luxury to be educated—we should consider that genuine freedom is the result of being well-educated in the broader sense. This doesn't mean merely accumulating facts, but rather cultivating the ability to think critically, make sound judgments, and remain unperturbed by life's unpredictability. For example, someone who has never sought to understand their own thoughts and emotions might remain a captive to fleeting anxieties and external pressures, while a person who has engaged deeply with philosophical ideas and self-reflection may find themselves at peace, regardless of the constraints life imposes. By seeking education not just as an academic endeavor but as a lifelong pursuit of personal growth and ethical understanding, we achieve an inner freedom that no external force can diminish. Thus, entrusting our development to a thoughtful inquiry into life's questions equips us with the autonomy to lead purposeful and serene lives, free from the turbulences that often unsettle those who only seek validation from the majority.
