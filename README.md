<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In our day-to-day lives, we often find ourselves tangled in stresses and worries that stem from things outside our control. Epictetus' wisdom reminds us to shift our focus towards distinguishing between what is within our power and what is not. This simple yet profound understanding can drastically reduce our stress levels. For example, we can control our efforts, attitudes, and reactions—but not the opinions or actions of others. Imagine being stuck in traffic; while you can't control the movement of cars, you can choose to use this time constructively, perhaps by listening to an audiobook or practicing deep breathing. By accepting that we can only influence our own thoughts and actions, we liberate ourselves from unnecessary anxieties. By concentrating on what truly lies within our power, we anchor ourselves to a source of enduring tranquility, as we no longer expend energy on circumstances beyond our command. This clarity provides a steady foundation, ensuring that we navigate life's unpredictabilities with peace and resilience.
