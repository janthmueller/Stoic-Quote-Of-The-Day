    <em>"“I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours.” But you, after all, are neither property nor style."</em><br>
    <strong>— Epictetus</strong>

    Our worth and identity should not be attached to external possessions or superficial talents. In today's world, it's easy to measure success by comparing wealth, possessions, or skills with others. For instance, someone might feel superior because they own a luxurious car or have excellent public speaking abilities. However, these aspects do not define the core of who we are as individuals. Our true self lies beyond material wealth and eloquence. Just like the ancient teachings of Epictetus suggest, we are not the things we own or the skills we display; instead, the essence of our being transcends these external markers. Real value comes from our character, virtues, and how we treat others. By focusing on developing our inner virtues—like kindness, wisdom, and resilience—we align ourselves with a deeper sense of fulfillment that isn't swayed by the fleeting nature of material and superficial accolades. In our interactions and pursuits, recognizing that we are far more than our possessions and skills can lead to a more authentic and grounded existence, fostering inner peace regardless of external circumstances.
