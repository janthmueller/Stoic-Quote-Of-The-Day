    <em>"Night brings our troubles to the light rather than banishes them."</em><br>
    <strong>â€” Seneca</strong>

    In the quiet solitude of night, when the hustle and bustle of daily life recede, our minds often turn inward, reflecting on the day's events and unearthing the things we might have been too busy to notice or process during daylight hours. Just as the stillness of the night offers a backdrop for stars to shine, it also provides a canvas for our thoughts and worries to come into focus. This can help us gain a clearer understanding of our challenges rather than allowing them to remain obscured by distractions. For instance, consider how at bedtime, people often replay conversations in their minds or anticipate the tasks of the next day, sometimes feeling unsettled by the things they'd rather forget. Instead of dismissing these moments as nuisances, acknowledging them can be illuminating, offering an opportunity for introspection and problem-solving. Thus, nighttime becomes a time for bringing what truly matters to light, allowing us to better understand and address our troubles, fostering resilience and clarity as we move forward.
