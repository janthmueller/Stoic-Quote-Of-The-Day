Why need we weep over parts of our life? the whole of it calls for tears: new miseries assail us before we have freed ourselves from the old ones.

Life, full as it is with its ups and downs, challenges us to encounter a continuous cycle of problems—just when one issue seems to be resolving, another often takes its place. Seneca captures this never-ending stream of experiences, and while it might initially sound pessimistic, there is a deeper wisdom in recognizing that life constantly presents difficulties. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of challenges, acknowledging their persistent nature can help us detach emotionally and see them as an inherent aspect of existence. For example, consider someone navigating career troubles while also dealing with family health issues. Recognizing that life perpetually offers us hurdles to overcome can help cultivate resilience and reduce the surprise and stress of new difficulties. It's not about resigning to a future of continuous struggle, but rather finding strength in understanding this cycle and preparing ourselves to face each challenge with calm acceptance and equanimity. This perspective liberates us from undue suffering by shifting the focus from despair to acceptance and proactive engagement with life's obstacles.
