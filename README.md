In this quote, Seneca is reminding us that true misfortune often finds its roots in our own misplaced expectations and attachments. When we experience a period of good luck or success, we might become complacent, assuming that fortune will consistently favor us. This leads us to place undue value on external circumstances like wealth, status, or comfort, believing these are permanent sources of happiness. However, when life inevitably changes course and adversity strikes, as it does for everyone, the shock can feel devastating, not because of the inherent misfortune, but because we've allowed ourselves to be misled by temporary pleasures. In modern life, this might look like becoming so attached to a high-paying job that when layoffs happen, as they sometimes do in volatile industries, one feels completely lost and broken. A Stoic approach would involve appreciating good times without becoming overly reliant on them, maintaining a steady inner contentment that is resilient to life's ups and downs. By grounding our sense of well-being in internal virtues like resilience and adaptable wisdom, rather than in the transient gifts of Fortune, we develop a fortitude that helps us navigate any challenge with equanimity.
