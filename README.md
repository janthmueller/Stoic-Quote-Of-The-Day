And indeed he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
When we make the pursuit of pleasure our ultimate goal and see pain as something to flee at all costs, we risk losing sight of deeper values and a meaningful life. Pleasure can be fleeting, offering temporary satisfaction but often leading us astray from what truly nourishes the soul. While it is tempting to seek out comfort and avoid discomfort in today’s world, filled with endless digital entertainment and the promise of instant gratification, this approach may distract us from personal growth and the cultivation of virtue. Similarly, seeing pain as only bad overlooks its role as a powerful teacher. Enduring challenges humbly can build resilience and empathy, much like how a difficult conversation or a strenuous workout can offer deep rewards despite their immediate discomfort. By focusing on what aligns with our principles and develops our character, rather than simply what feels good or easy in the moment, we honor a deeper purpose. In this way, we live in harmony with the universe's order, recognizing that enduring certain hardships or forgoing superficial pleasures can lead to greater inner stability and wisdom.
