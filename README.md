Why do you wonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you always take yourself with you? The reason which set you wandering is ever at your heels.

When you travel the world in search of escape or happiness, hoping these can be found in a change of scenery, you may find yourself repeatedly disappointed. The critical insight here is that your state of mind and personal challenges accompany you, regardless of your physical location. If discontent or restlessness drives your wanderlust, simply moving from place to place does not resolve these feelings. Imagine someone dissatisfied with their job or relationship. They may move to a new city, believing this change will bring a fresh start, yet soon find themselves unhappy again. This is because the underlying issues—be it dissatisfaction, unfulfilled desires, or personal habits—remain unaddressed. In essence, external changes do not alter internal states. The true journey to lasting contentment or peace involves self-reflection and addressing the root causes within oneself, rather than seeking external solutions. This subtle wisdom reminds us that while travel can enrich and expand our horizons, inner work is essential for genuine transformation and contentment.
