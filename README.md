For then thou wilt neither blame those who offend involuntarily, nor wilt thou want their approbation, if thou lookest to the sources of their opinions and appetites.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Embracing the Stoic perspective shared by Marcus Aurelius, we cultivate a sense of understanding and patience toward others who might behave unfavorably. When someone offends us, often they do so involuntarily, driven by their own experiences, beliefs, or misunderstandings. By striving to understand the roots of their opinions and desires, we naturally develop compassion and reduce our inclination to blame them. In our daily lives, whether dealing with a colleague's abrupt remarks during a stressful project or encountering a stranger’s impatience in a long line, remembering that everyone acts based on personal influences and motivations can ease potential friction. Furthermore, this approach helps us remain secure in our own values without seeking constant approval from others, knowing their judgments are shaped by their individual perceptions. This perspective fosters a more forgiving, empathetic outlook, allowing us to navigate social complexities with grace and composure, mindful that, like us, others are also learning as they go.
