How can you wonder your travels do you no good, when you carry yourself around with you? You are saddled with the very thing that drove you away.

When Seneca talks about carrying "yourself around with you" on your travels, he underscores the idea that true contentment and peace are derived from our internal condition rather than our external circumstances. When we seek to escape dissatisfaction or unhappiness by changing our surroundings, we often find that the root of our discomfort remains because it resides within us. Consider a person who moves to a new city, yearning for a fresh start, but quickly discovers that the same stress and dissatisfaction pursue them. This is because they have brought along their worries, habits, and outlook on life—the true sources of their discontent. Instead of seeking fulfillment through external changes, Stoicism encourages cultivating a serene and resilient mindset. By addressing internal issues—our perceptions, responses, and expectations—we find that peace and happiness become more consistent, regardless of where we are. In today's fast-paced world, this can mean taking the time for introspection and self-improvement, learning to manage stress, and nurturing gratitude, enabling a sense of well-being that can flourish amidst any backdrop.
