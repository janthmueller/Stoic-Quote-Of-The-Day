Spurn everything that is added by way of decoration and display by unneccesary labour. Relect that nothing merits admiration except the spirit, the impressiveness of which prevents it from being impressed by anything.

True admirability lies not in external adornments but within the resilience of the human spirit. In an age where digital validation and material embellishments are often pursued as symbols of success or worth, it's easy to be caught up in superficial pursuits that demand unnecessary effort. Yet, the kind of achievement that truly deserves our respect does not depend on outward displays or excessive labor to enhance our appearance or status. Instead, it is the strength of character and the inner fortitude that prevent us from being swayed by these ephemeral embellishments that truly holds value. Much like weathering a storm with an unwavering resolve or navigating life's challenges without anxiety over external judgments, focusing on cultivating such inner resilience and autonomy is key. When your spirit remains undisturbed by the glint of external allure, you find a robust center within yourself, freeing you from the endless cycle of comparison and societal pressures. Thus, in any pursuit, endeavor to polish the virtues of your inner world—it is the lasting, unadorned strength of your spirit that warrants genuine admiration and guides you through the vicissitudes of contemporary life.
