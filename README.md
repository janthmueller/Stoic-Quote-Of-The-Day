Let us keep to the way which Nature has mapped out for us, and let us not swerve therefrom. If we follow Nature, all is easy and unobstructed; but if we combat Nature, our life differs not a whit from that of men who row against the current.

Following the natural course of life, as suggested by Seneca, involves aligning our actions and attitudes with the reality of the world around us. In a modern context, this might mean accepting things we cannot control, such as changes in economic conditions or the behavior of other people. When we resist these realities and attempt to force situations to conform to our desires, we only fill our lives with struggle and frustration—much like rowing against a powerful current. Instead, by embracing the natural flow of life, we find ease and clarity in our journey, enabling us to conserve energy and focus on what truly matters. A practical example could be in the workplace: rather than lamenting a sudden shift in company policy, we adapt and find new ways to thrive within the new system. By doing so, we reduce our stress and position ourselves better for success. This Stoic approach encourages us to be flexible and resilient, understanding that harmonizing with the inevitable changes of life gives us peace and momentum, rather like a leaf carried effortlessly down a stream.
