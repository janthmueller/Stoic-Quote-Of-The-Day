One of the causes of the troubles that beset us is the way our lives are guided by the example of others; instead of being set to rights by reason we’re seduced by convention.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In our daily lives, we often find ourselves following the actions and beliefs of those around us without questioning whether they are truly beneficial or aligned with our personal values. This tendency to be influenced by the example of others can lead to difficulties because it often means that our decisions are being shaped by societal norms rather than thoughtful reasoning. Consider someone working in a high-pressure job simply because that's what their family or peers expect, even though it doesn’t fulfill them. Instead of taking a step back to evaluate what genuinely matters to them, they march along a path dictated by external pressures. By prioritizing reason over convention, we allow ourselves the clarity to pursue a life guided by true understanding and purpose rather than just going along with the flow. Embracing this approach empowers us to make choices that cultivate personal growth and resilience, fostering a life of integrity and inner peace amidst the noise of conformity.
