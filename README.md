There is but one way to tranquility of mind and happiness, and that is to account no external things thine own, but to commit all to God.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In seeking true peace of mind and happiness, it's essential to understand that contentment does not come from external possessions or circumstances, as they are often beyond our control. Instead, tranquility is found in recognizing that the fate of such externalities—whether it's material wealth, public acknowledgment, or even the behavior of others—is not ours to command or possess. By surrendering the need to control these outside influences and trusting in a greater plan—or, in ancient Stoic terms, "committing all to God"—we free ourselves from the burden of anxiety and disappointment. In modern life, this perspective encourages us to focus our efforts on what we can influence, such as our own actions, reactions, and attitudes. For instance, rather than fretting over a job promotion or how others perceive us, we concentrate on doing our best in our current role and cultivating genuine relationships. In this release of control over the external world and its outcomes, we find a profound and lasting peace, allowing us to engage deeply in life without the constant turmoil of unmet expectations.
