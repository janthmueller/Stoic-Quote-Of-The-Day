    <em>"The past is ours, and there is nothing more secure for us than that which has been. We are ungrateful for past gains, because we hope for the future, as if the future – if so be that any future is ours – will not be quickly blended with the past."</em><br>
    <strong>— Seneca</strong>

    Seneca's words remind us that the past, with all its experiences and lessons, is the only certainty we possess, providing a foundation for understanding our present reality. In our contemporary lives, people often fixate on the future, pinning their hopes and dreams on what is yet to come, while overlooking the intrinsic value of past achievements and experiences. Whether it’s cherishing a job promotion or learning from past mistakes, recognizing the significance of what has been can ground us, offering resilience against the uncertainties that the future holds. Just as a missed opportunity in the past may have indirectly guided us to a better path, acknowledging these experiences fosters gratitude and wisdom. Embracing these past gains can calm our anxieties about what’s next, allowing us to appreciate the familiar knowledge and growth already acquired, rather than seeking fulfillment in speculative future scenarios. In this way, Seneca invites us to cherish the now, rooted in the life we’ve already lived, and to approach the uncertainty of the future with a well-informed serenity.
