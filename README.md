    <em>"We are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands."</em><br>
    <strong>— Seneca</strong>

    In reflecting on the passage of time, Seneca invites us to reconsider how we perceive life's finitude by emphasizing that every day is, in a sense, a step further into our eventual mortality. This thought can encourage us to cherish the present moment more fully, understanding that the years we've already lived are no longer ours to hold onto. By realizing that death is not just a distant event but part of the continuum we live through each day, we might find value in living with intention and presence. Instead of fixating on what's to come, worrying about the inevitable end, we can make better use of our time by being more aware of the here and now. In today's fast-paced world, this perspective might mean taking a moment away from our screens to engage in conversation with a friend, or cherishing a quiet walk in nature, appreciating the beauty and peace of the current moment. By recognizing that we are always in the process of moving through life—and through time—we might be inspired to add greater meaning to our everyday actions, living in a way that aligns with our true values and aspirations.
