Many pursue no fixed goal, but are tossed about in ever-changing designs by a fickleness which is shifting, inconstant and never satisfied with itself.

Seneca speaks to the importance of having a steady purpose in life, warning against the allure of constant change and indecision. In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to be swept up in a whirlwind of options and distractions—from job opportunities to social media trends—without ever settling on a clear direction. The lack of a fixed goal means a person is continually thrown by life’s unpredictability, like a ship without a rudder caught in capricious winds. This state of perpetual flux leaves individuals feeling unsatisfied because they never fully commit to one path long enough to see it through to completion or to understand their true desires. By setting and pursuing a clear objective, whether it's a personal value like becoming kinder or a professional ambition like mastering a craft, one cultivates a sense of stability and purpose. This grounded approach allows individuals to navigate life’s uncertainties with confidence and resilience, making each decision more intentional and fulfilling. In contrast, living without clear aims results in a restless pursuit of novelty that ultimately leaves one feeling adrift and incomplete.
