However much you possess there's someone else who has more, and you'll be fancying yourself to be short of things you need to exact extent to which you lag behind him.

Seneca's observation points to the endless cycle of comparison and the dissatisfaction it breeds. In contemporary life, it's easy to look at social media, neighbors, or colleagues and feel like we're lacking in some way because someone else seems to have more—whether it's a bigger house, a higher salary, or more luxurious vacations. This habit of constantly measuring our worth against others leads to a perpetual sense of insufficiency, as there's always someone who appears to be more successful or better off. Instead of falling into this trap, Stoic philosophy encourages us to focus on what we can control: our own values, contentment, and gratitude for what we already have. By shifting our attention to personal growth and appreciating the present, we can find fulfillment without endlessly chasing after the achievements or possessions of others. In a world where external validations often dominate, returning to our internal values can create a sense of peace and resilience.
