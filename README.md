No one keeps himself waiting; and yet the greatest cure for anger is to wait, so that the initial passion it engenders may die down, and the fog that shrouds the mind may subside, or become less thick.

In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to become impulsively angry at the smallest disruptions—like a delayed flight, a harsh comment on social media, or a disagreement at work. Seneca's wisdom suggests that although we're all naturally inclined to act immediately, particularly when emotions flare up, the real power lies in restraint. By allowing ourselves a moment to pause and wait, we're granting space for the intense emotions to settle and dissipate. In that quiet, we find clarity and perspective, akin to how fog lifts to reveal a clearer view. This waiting isn't passive but active, as it requires conscious effort to resist the urge to react. In practical terms, this might mean taking a deep breath, walking away for a few minutes, or sleeping on a decision before responding. Through this practice, which serves as the greatest antidote to unproductive anger, we allow our reasoned judgment to emerge, leading to more constructive responses and healthier interactions. By waiting, we regain control over our emotions and ultimately, our lives.
