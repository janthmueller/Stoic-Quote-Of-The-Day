But he must have richly dyed purple clothes, woven with gold thread and decorated with multicoloured patterns: it is his fault, not nature’s, if he feels poor.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In this passage, Seneca highlights how our perception of wealth and poverty is often shaped more by our desires and standards than by any actual need. He uses the vivid imagery of someone who requires luxurious, extravagant clothing to feel wealthy, to suggest that it is not an objective condition of poverty imposed by nature but a subjective dissatisfaction created by one's own unmet expectations. In modern life, this idea resonates when people always long for the latest gadgets, designer clothes, or high-status cars to feel successful or fulfilled. Rather than appreciating what they have, they may feel impoverished because they constantly compare themselves to others who seem to have more. Seneca suggests that if we shift our mindset away from excessive desires and external validations, we can find contentment and richness in simplicity and self-sufficiency. By valuing what we already possess and understanding that true wealth comes from within, we liberate ourselves from the endless pursuit of possessions that ultimately do little to satiate our deeper sense of contentment and value.
