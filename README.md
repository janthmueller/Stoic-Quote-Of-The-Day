    <em>"You ask what is the proper limit to a person's wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough."</em><br>
    <strong>— Seneca</strong>
</p>

<p align="center" style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;">
    Seneca encourages us to reconsider the idea of wealth, suggesting that its true value lies not in abundance but in sufficiency and necessity. In a world that often equates success with the endless accumulation of material possessions, this perspective offers a liberating shift. Imagine someone who continually buys the latest smartphone, bigger homes, or luxury cars, always seeking the next upgrade in pursuit of satisfaction. Yet, amidst this chase, they may overlook the fulfillment found in recognizing what is truly essential—such as having a safe place to live, enough food for nourishment, and meaningful experiences with friends and family. Seneca invites us to define wealth in terms of contentment with what we need and deem "enough," rather than unending desires. By appreciating what is necessary and setting boundaries on our material wants, we can achieve a sense of peace and gratitude, ultimately allowing us to focus on cultivating deeper connections and experiences that bring genuine satisfaction and happiness.
