The part of life we really live is small. For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In our busy, modern lives, it’s easy to fill our days with activities and distractions that, while occupying our hours, don’t genuinely bring us closer to the essence of what it means to truly live. Seneca's insight invites us to reflect on the difference between merely passing time and living with intention and purpose. Consider the difference between scrolling through social media feeds to kill time and spending quality moments connecting with loved ones or engaging deeply in a hobby you love. The former might fill your day, but it leaves little in the way of meaningful experience. To live fully, then, is to focus on those moments that enrich our spirit and align with our true values—whether it's an afternoon spent in nature, a conversation that lights up our mind, or a personal project that fulfills us. As we navigate the rapid pace of contemporary life, keeping this perspective encourages us to prioritize deep, purposeful engagements over the endless litany of time-filling distractions, ensuring that the 'small' part of our lives we truly live is intentional and fulfilling.
