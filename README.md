This evil of taking our cue from others has become so deeply ingrained that even that most basic feeling, grief, degenerates into imitation.

Seneca is inviting us to examine how our emotions, particularly grief, can often be shaped not by our personal experiences, but by what we observe and absorb from others. In today’s world, the influence of social media and the constant comparison to others can exacerbate this phenomenon. When we see public displays of mourning, whether it's in celebrities mourning the loss of a loved one or the outpouring of emotion over a global event, there's a tendency to mimic these expressions, even if they don't align with our deepest personal feelings. This occurs because, as humans, we are social creatures, naturally inclined to match the emotional tone set by those around us, mistaking this alignment for authenticity in our response. The danger lies in allowing these external cues to overshadow our genuine personal experience, potentially causing us to act disingenuously. By recognizing this, we can strive to foster an emotional life that is less about conforming to social expectations and more about understanding and expressing our true selves. In doing so, we remain connected to our intrinsic values and feelings, leading a life that is more authentic and grounded.
