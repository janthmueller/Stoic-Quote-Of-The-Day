The happiness and unhappiness of the rational, social animal depends not on what he feels but on what he does; just as his virtue and vice consist not in feeling but in doing.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In our fast-paced world, where emotions often run high and social media emphasizes feelings, it's easy to conflate happiness with how we feel at any given moment. However, this perspective encourages us to shift focus from the transient nature of emotions to our actions and behaviors, which hold a deeper connection to our well-being. Consider a scenario where someone faces criticism at work. Rather than allowing the initial sting of negative feedback to dictate their mood, a more productive approach would involve assessing the critique objectively and deciding on actionable steps to improve. Happiness, in this sense, stems from our choices and actions rather than the fleeting emotions we experience. Similarly, virtues such as kindness, patience, and courage are embodied through our actions—helping a colleague with a project or standing up for someone who is treated unfairly—rather than being mere feelings we harbor internally. By aligning our actions with our values, we can cultivate a more enduring sense of fulfillment and integrity. Thus, our true character in life is shaped not by how we feel in response to life's challenges but by how we choose to respond through deliberate, principled actions.
