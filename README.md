Seneca's observation reminds us that wealth, much like any other tool or resource, holds as much power over us as we choose to give it. For the wise person, wealth is merely a servant—a means to an end, a tool that can be used to support their values, foster personal growth, or contribute to the well-being of their community. They understand that material wealth is transient and doesn’t define their worth or happiness. In contrast, the fool becomes ensnared by riches, allowing money to dictate their choices, govern their happiness, and define their self-worth. In today's world, this lesson is particularly relevant as many find themselves equating financial success with personal success. Amidst social media's endless comparisons and consumer culture's pressures, it is easy to measure one's value by possessions or bank balances. However, when wealth takes the helm, individuals can lose sight of what truly matters—relationships, integrity, and inner peace. Understanding wealth as merely a tool rather than a measure of one’s life creates the freedom to live according to our principles rather than constantly chasing external validation. This view opens the way for wisdom to guide our spending, saving, and giving, positioning wealth as a helpful servant rather than a demanding master.
