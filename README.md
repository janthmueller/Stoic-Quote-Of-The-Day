You are retained as counsel for unhappy mankind. You have promised to help those in peril by sea, those in captivity, the sick and the needy, and those whose heads are under the poised axe. Whither are you straying? What are you doing?

In this quote, Seneca encourages us to focus on the essential responsibility we bear toward our fellow human beings, serving as a compassionate force in their lives. This timeless idea reminds us that amidst life's distractions and personal pursuits, we have a duty to aid those in distress—whether they are navigating turbulent times, enduring the shackles of hardship, battling illness, or teetering on the brink of emotional or literal crisis. Just as a lawyer would be dedicated to offering counsel and support during troubled times, we are gently urged to examine our actions and intentions, ensuring we do not stray from our role to offer empathy and assistance. In our modern world, this might manifest in various ways: offering a listening ear to a stressed colleague, volunteering to help those less fortunate in our community, or even reaching out to a friend who is facing a personal crisis. The essence is to stay present and consciously choose to enact good, rather than getting swept away by the superficial or self-centered aspects of life. By actively embracing this role, we cultivate not only compassion and wisdom but also a deeper connection, both to ourselves and to the broader human experience.
