There is a kind of river of things passing into being and Time is a violent torrent. For no sooner is each seen, than it has been carried away, and another is being carried by, and that, too, will be carried away.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Life is much like a flowing river, with moments constantly emerging and then swiftly vanishing, akin to watching a leaf float by only to disappear from view as another takes its place. This imagery from Marcus Aurelius serves as a gentle reminder of the transient nature of our existence. Each moment we experience, whether pleasurable or challenging, is fleeting and soon replaced by the next. In our fast-paced modern world, where changes happen rapidly—like shifting jobs, evolving relationships, or the relentless cycle of news—it’s easy to feel caught up in the rush. By recognizing this perpetual state of flux, we can learn to embrace the present without clinging to the past or anxiously anticipating the future. This perspective encourages us to savor today’s experiences and let go of any attachments to what has passed or worries about what yet may come, fostering resilience and serenity amidst life's inevitable changes.
