And what’s so bad about your being deprived of that? All things seem unbearable to people who have become spoilt, who have become soft through a life of luxury, ailing more in the mind than they ever are in the body.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
When life indulges us with luxury and comfort, we can unknowingly build a dependency on these pleasures, leading us to perceive their absence as unbearable. Seneca’s words remind us that true hardship often exists more in our minds than in our actual circumstances, especially when we have grown accustomed to an easy life. As we navigate modern life, facing minor inconveniences—like a delay in our Wi-Fi connection or a favorite item out of stock—can feel surprisingly overwhelming if we allow our minds to fixate on these disruptions as serious deprivations. Stoicism encourages us to cultivate resilience by recognizing that many hardships are merely illusions amplified by a spoiled perspective. By understanding and accepting the temporary nature of such situations, we can find peace and maintain our mental strength. Embracing a mindset of adaptability and gratitude allows us to face life's challenges with equanimity, appreciating what we have without becoming overly reliant on external comforts. This approach does not mean dismissing our desires or comforts but rather maintaining awareness of how they can subtly shift from enhancing life to ruling it, guiding us to find contentment in simpler, more enduring sources of happiness.
