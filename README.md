    <em>"No one keeps himself waiting; and yet the greatest cure for anger is to wait, so that the initial passion it engenders may die down, and the fog that shrouds the mind may subside, or become less thick."</em><br>
    <strong>â€” Seneca</strong>

    In our fast-paced world, the inclination to react immediately when faced with frustration or provocation is common. Imagine someone cutting you off in traffic, or a colleague unfairly criticizing your work; the immediate surge of anger can be overwhelming. Seneca suggests that instead of succumbing to these instant emotional reactions, we should allow ourselves a moment to pause. Patience becomes a powerful tool, offering a chance for our intense emotional responses to simmer down, much like a storm clearing away to reveal a clearer sky. By delaying our reactions, we grant ourselves time for the initial heat of anger to cool, enabling us to regain clarity and reason. This deliberate pause creates space for reflection, allowing us to see the situation more objectively and choose a response grounded in wisdom rather than impulsiveness. In everyday scenarios, this might mean taking a few deep breaths before responding to an inflammatory email or stepping away from a heated conversation. With practice, this approach transforms the way we handle anger, fostering calmer and more constructive interactions.
