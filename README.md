If a great man falls and remains great as he lies, people no more despise him than they stamp on a fallen temple, which the devout still worship as much as when it was standing.

Seneca suggests that true greatness transcends temporary setbacks, much like a revered temple retains its sanctity even when collapsed. In our modern lives, this can be applied to how we perceive and respond to personal failures or challenges. For instance, a respected leader or role model may stumble publicly, whether through a failed business venture or a personal shortcoming. Despite this fall, if the individual maintains personal integrity, humility, and a continued commitment to their values, their intrinsic worth remains unchanged. Just as one would still marvel at the ruins of a historically significant monument, recognizing its former grandeur and lasting impact, we can still honor and respect individuals who, despite their downfalls, embody enduring qualities of wisdom, courage, or kindness. This perspective invites us to differentiate between temporary failures and lasting character, encouraging us to support one another in times of difficulty with empathy and understanding, knowing that integrity and the respect it earns endure beyond immediate circumstances.
