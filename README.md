Life is divided into three parts: what was, what is and what shall be. Of these three periods, the present is short, the future is doubtful and the past alone is certain.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In Seneca's description of life as divided into the past, present, and future, we can find a powerful reminder about the nature of time and our own perspective on it. The present moment is fleeting, a brief, ephemeral point that we must experience immediately before it slips into the domain of the past. In today’s fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the rush, forgetting to truly inhabit and appreciate our present because we're too anxious about the uncertainty of the future or too fixated on what has already happened. Understanding that the future is inherently unpredictable and that worrying over it can drain our current peace helps us channel our energy more constructively. Meanwhile, the past — though it cannot be altered — holds certainty. It offers lessons, memories, and a grounding sense of history, but dwelling there for too long can prevent us from making the most of now. So, as we scroll through social media feeds or get wrapped up in work deadlines, Seneca nudges us to re-anchor ourselves in the present. By accepting the certainty of the past and embracing the unpredictable beauty of the future without fret, we can cultivate a sense of calm and focus, enabling us to lead a more centered, meaningful life, even amid the unpredictability of modern times.
