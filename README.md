Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how often a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by the gods, thou hast neglected it.

The essence of this Stoic insight is a call to action, reminding us of the countless opportunities for growth and positive change we've let slip away. In the hustle and bustle of modern life, we often find ourselves procrastinating, waiting for the "right moment" to start exercising, pursue a career change, or reconcile with someone important. Yet, these moments rarely announce themselves with grandeur; rather, they pass quietly, waiting for us to seize them. Marcus Aurelius gently urges us to reflect on the accumulation of times we've delayed meaningful pursuits, each instance a day or hour that could have sparked transformation. Just as he considered such times divinely appointed, we too should mark these as chances gifted by life itself—not to be put off indefinitely. In a contemporary context, recognize that the emails left unanswered, the dreams unchased, and the conversations avoided are akin to those neglected divine appointments. By embracing the full potential of now, we honor these deliberately unmarked moments, ensuring they don't become yet another missed opportunity in the timeline of our lives.
