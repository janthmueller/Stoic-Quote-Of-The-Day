You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own ruling faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within or without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the vulgar.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In life, we are often faced with a choice between focusing on our inner selves or on external circumstances. Epictetus invites us to consider the path of cultivating our internal virtues rather than being overly concerned with the opinions, possessions, or status that others deem important. By doing so, we align ourselves with the path of philosophy, committing to introspection and self-improvement. This mindset encourages us to focus on what truly matters—our thoughts, actions, and character. In everyday terms, imagine you're faced with a challenging project at work. You can either fret about how others will judge your performance or concentrate on doing your best, learning, and growing from the experience. Like cultivating a garden, nurturing our inner virtues allows us to flourish regardless of external conditions, leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. Choosing to develop our inner selves empowers us to rise above the superficial concerns of the "vulgar" world, enabling us to live with integrity and resilience.
