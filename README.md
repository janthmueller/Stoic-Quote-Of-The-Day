Therefore, nothing ought to be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent forward in advance to meet all problems, and we should consider, not what is wont to happen, but what can happen.

In our daily lives, it's easy to be caught off guard by unexpected challenges, whether it's a sudden job loss, a relationship ending, or a health scare. Seneca encourages us to prepare our minds for all possibilities, extending our thoughts forward to envision not just the routine occurrences but also the less likely, yet possible, events. By doing so, we cultivate resilience, reducing the impact of shock when faced with adversity. Just as a pilot charts multiple flight paths to account for potential turbulence, we should mentally rehearse different scenarios, understanding that life is unpredictable by nature. This foresight doesn't mean dwelling in dread; rather, it strengthens our capacity to respond calmly and adaptively, fostering a sense of readiness and acceptance. In today's world, where change happens rapidly and unpredictability is common, such mental preparedness can help us navigate ups and downs with grace and composure, knowing we've anticipated life's shifting tides.
