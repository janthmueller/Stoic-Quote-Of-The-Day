    <em>"There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will."</em><br>
    <strong>— Epictetus</strong>

    In life, peace and happiness often elude us not because of the challenges we face, but because of how much energy we expend worrying about factors outside our control. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, reminds us that true contentment arises when we focus on what lies within the realm of our influence. Imagine you're anxiously waiting for the outcome of a job interview. While it's natural to feel concerned, fixating on the decision itself—which is in the hands of the employer—can lead to unnecessary stress. Instead, channel that energy into refining your skills or preparing for future opportunities. Similarly, consider our reactions to weather anticipated on an important day. While we can't change an unexpected rainstorm, we can control how we respond—by choosing to carry an umbrella or adjusting our plans cheerfully. By accepting that external events, other people’s choices, and certain life circumstances are beyond our control, we free ourselves from the shackles of constant worry. It's in this relinquishment that we find peace, directing our attention and efforts towards what we can shape: our thoughts, responses, and actions. Through this shift in focus, like a gentle release of tension, we unlock a pathway to happiness and a life lived with equanimity amidst uncertainty.
