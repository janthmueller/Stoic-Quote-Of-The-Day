  <em>"No one can lose either the past or the future - how could anyone be deprived of what he does not possess? ... It is only the present moment of which either stands to be deprived: and if this is all he has, he cannot lose what he does not have."</em><br>
  <strong>â€” Marcus Aurelius</strong>
