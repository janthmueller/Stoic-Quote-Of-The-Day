And why is it so hard when things go against you? If it’s imposed by nature, accept it gladly and stop fighting it. And if not, work out what your own nature requires, and aim at that, even if it brings you no glory.

When faced with adversity, it can be a struggle to maintain composure and peace of mind, especially when things don't go as planned or hoped. However, recognizing the natural order of the world and accepting that not everything is within our control can alleviate much of the frustration and resistance we feel. If a situation is dictated by the laws of nature—like the inevitability of illness, loss, or the passage of time—it is more beneficial to embrace these challenges with resilience rather than to resist them, as resistance only amplifies distress. On the other hand, when circumstances are within the realm of human influence, it is crucial to align our actions with our true nature and personal values. This might mean pursuing paths that are meaningful to us, even if they don't result in external admiration or success. For instance, a person may choose a career that aligns with their values of helping others, despite it not being the most lucrative or prestigious option. By focusing on what deeply resonates with our inner sense of purpose, we fulfill our authentic self, finding contentment in the act rather than the accolades. Accepting what is beyond our control and living in accordance with our nature allows us to approach life's challenges with grace and a clear sense of direction, leading to genuine inner fulfillment.
