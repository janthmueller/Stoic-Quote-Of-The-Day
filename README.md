From my great-grandfather: not to have attended schools for the public; to have had good teachers at home, and to realize that this is the sort of thing on which one should spend lavishly.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the value of investing in personal, tailored education over conventional, one-size-fits-all schooling. This idea suggests that genuine learning comes from mentorship and guidance adapted to the individual’s needs, rather than from generalized institutions. In today’s world, this can be likened to the importance of seeking personalized coaching, mentorship, or workshops that resonate with your personal interests or professional goals. Just as Marcus learned to cherish individualized instruction, we too can prioritize cultivating skill development and wisdom through experiences and educators that speak directly to our personal journeys. For instance, someone aspiring to excel in a specific craft might spend time with a skilled mentor, focusing resources on experiences that uniquely contribute to their growth, rather than relying solely on traditional educational paths. This mindset encourages us to recognize the profound impact of bespoke learning opportunities in developing our character and capabilities and to invest in these whenever possible.
