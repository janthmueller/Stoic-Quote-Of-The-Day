    <em>"It is a question whether he died by his own hand; for he fell from a sudden wound received in his groin, some doubting whether his death was voluntary, no one, whether it was timely."</em><br>
    <strong>— Seneca</strong>

    In life, the inevitability of death is a constant and unavoidable truth, and Seneca's words explore the contemplative space surrounding the nature and timing of this final act. The fact that someone might have control over how they meet their end is enveloped in uncertainty. It raises the question of agency versus fate. However, what is truly beyond debate is the timeliness of death's arrival; regardless of our plans or desires, it seldom aligns with our own expectations or timing. Imagine a person unexpectedly losing their job, an event they neither planned nor wanted. While this can cause initial distress, they may eventually reflect on how this unanticipated occurrence opened doors they hadn’t considered before, like starting a new career path that ultimately proves more fulfilling. In the same manner, the inevitability of change—and ultimately death—is something we must accept. Rather than focusing on controlling these outcomes, we find peace by preparing ourselves to face each moment openly and with readiness, regardless of how or when they appear. Life's uncertainties, like those surrounding death, remind us to focus on how we live now, rather than when or how everything concludes.
