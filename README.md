It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control over the faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our mind from error.

In our daily lives, situations themselves do not inherently disturb us; rather, it is our interpretations and perceptions that shape our emotional responses. Imagine receiving criticism at work; it is not the critique itself causing distress, but our internal narrative that might exaggerate its implications, perhaps perceiving it as a threat to our abilities or worth. Marcus Aurelius reminds us of the power we hold in reframing our perspectives. By training our minds to pause and question whether our initial reactions are based on assumptions or facts, we can avoid unnecessary anguish. Approaching situations with a calm and rational mindset allows us to protect ourselves from jumping to conclusions or harboring resentment. This practice of vigilant perception helps safeguard our mental clarity and well-being, enabling us to respond to life's challenges with resilience and grace. Therefore, the control we exercise over our judgments and the meaning we ascribe to experiences play a crucial role in leading a peaceful life, free from self-inflicted turmoil.
