Where is harm to be found? In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Harm often resides not in the events themselves, but in our perception and interpretation of them. Marcus Aurelius touches on the idea that it's our internal response to challenges, more than the external circumstances themselves, that determines the extent to which they affect us. In today's world, for instance, consider the stress that comes from criticism at work. If you perceive the critique as an attack on your competencies or self-worth, it feels harmful and damaging. However, by choosing to see it as constructive feedback or an opportunity for growth, you can neutralize its negative impact. Similarly, problems arise in personal relationships when misunderstandings occur. If you assume the worst intentions, you may feel deeply hurt, but approaching the situation with openness and seeking clarification can transform a potential conflict into a strengthening conversation. By developing a habit of altering how we perceive challenges, shifting focus from defensiveness to understanding or acceptance, we can lead a more tranquil and resilient existence. So, the key lies in your perspective: by ceasing to see situations as harmful, you inherently reduce their capacity to harm you, allowing everything to be fine.
