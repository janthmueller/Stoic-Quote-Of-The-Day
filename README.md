Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
The heart of Seneca's message lies in the importance of depth over breadth when it comes to personal connections and experiences. Constantly flitting from one place to another in pursuit of adventure or novelty might yield a colorful array of experiences and people, yet it risks fostering superficial relationships and a fragmented sense of belonging. Today, this might parallel a life spent hopping from job to job, scrolling through endless social media feeds, or chasing the latest trends without truly investing in or committing to anything meaningful. While it can be exhilarating to collect diverse encounters and acquaintances, they often lack the richness and fulfillment that come from deeper, sustained interactions. By slowing down and embracing presence and connection, akin to nurturing a few close friendships rather than accumulating countless casual ones, we cultivate a sense of rootedness and true understanding. In essence, Seneca advises us to find substance and fulfillment not in the quantity of our experiences or social interactions, but in their quality—encouraging us to immerse ourselves fully in fewer, more meaningful aspects of life to forge genuine relationships and a sense of home.
