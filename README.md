    <em>"Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession."</em><br>
    <strong>— Seneca</strong>

    Time is the only true possession we have, according to Seneca, highlighting how everything else in life—from material wealth to external circumstances—is ultimately transient and can be taken away without warning. Understanding that time is our sole, truly owned asset can transform how we perceive and prioritize our daily lives. In our modern world, the distractions and demands on our attention are endless: we scroll through social media, binge-watch series, and chase after fleeting pleasures or external validations. These activities, although enjoyable, can sometimes lead us to neglect the finite nature of our time. By recognizing time as our most valuable resource, we can make more conscious choices about how we spend it, focusing on meaningful experiences, personal growth, and nurturing relationships. Doing so not only enriches our lives but also aligns us with a deeper purpose, making sure that, even amidst life's chaos, we retain our ownership of the time that truly belongs to us. Every moment we choose to be present and mindful underscores the preciousness of our days, reminding us to live with intention and gratitude.
