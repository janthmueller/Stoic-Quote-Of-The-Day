<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Death is an inevitable part of life, unpredictable and without a specific appointment. Seneca's wisdom urges us to live with the awareness that death can come at any moment, inviting us to embrace life fully and not take time for granted. In today's world, this can translate into appreciating each day, maintaining meaningful relationships, and not deferring joy or passions for an uncertain future. It encourages us not to postpone living, assuming we'll have time later, but instead to find fulfillment in the present. By expecting death "everywhere," we remain grounded, understanding that the uncertainties of life are what make each moment precious. Whether we’re at work, spending time with family, or walking through our daily routines, holding this perspective invites us to focus on what truly matters, fostering peace and a deeper connection with the world around us. Rather than viewing this as a morbid outlook, it gifts us the motivation to lead our lives authentically and with purpose, knowing that a life lived well is a life ready to meet death whenever it arrives.
