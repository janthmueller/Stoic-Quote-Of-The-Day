Even chance is not divorced from nature, from the inweaving and and enfolding of things governed by Providence.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In life, we often encounter events that seem random or dictated by sheer chance, leading us to question the chaos around us. Marcus Aurelius suggests that even these seemingly random occurrences fall under the natural order and greater wisdom of Providence, or the universal reason. This idea urges us to see every aspect of life as interconnected—whether it feels closely planned or spontaneously occurring—part of a larger tapestry beyond our immediate understanding. Just as a sudden rainstorm might alter our plans yet nourish the earth, these unexpected events can hold unforeseen benefits or lessons. In modern life, for instance, missing a train might feel like mere bad luck, but it might lead us to a meaningful conversation with a stranger or give us time to reflect on our day. Recognizing that chance events are woven into the fabric of our existence can help us accept what happens with equanimity, eliminating resistance and opening us to growth and understanding. This Stoic perspective encourages us to trust in this greater order and to face whatever comes our way with calm and resilience.
