For sheep don't throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk.

In this metaphor, Epictetus emphasizes the value of internalizing knowledge and personal growth rather than flaunting what we know to others for superficial applause. Just as sheep don't boast about their meals but quietly digest what they've ingested to produce beneficial wool and milk, we should focus on absorbing and applying our learnings to become better people without the need for external validation. True wisdom and virtues become evident through our actions and the positive impact we have on others, rather than through ostentatious displays or declarations of what we've learned. In today's world, this can be seen in the way some people seek constant recognition on social media, displaying accomplishments or insights for approval rather than letting their quiet transformations naturally reflect in how they live and interact with the world. The idea here is to cultivate a mindset where genuine betterment and the development of one's character take precedence over the need for outside approval, understanding that the real measure of growth lies in how it manifests in what we contribute to the lives of those around us.
