Remember, however, that thou art formed by nature to bear everything, with respect to which it depends on thy own opinion to make it endurable and tolerable, by thinking that it is either thy interest or thy duty to do this.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In life, many circumstances will challenge us, but remember that you possess the inner resilience to endure them. The Stoics believed that our minds hold the key to transforming difficult experiences into manageable ones. By shaping our perceptions, we can decide whether these situations serve our interests or fulfill a sense of duty. Imagine a stressful work project: you might feel overwhelmed initially, but by reframing it as an opportunity for growth or as part of your responsibility, the burden becomes lighter. This mindset doesn't change the circumstances themselves but alters how you engage with them, turning potential sources of stress into tasks you feel equipped to handle. In everyday life, whether dealing with personal setbacks or global uncertainties, remember your capacity to adapt through perspective, finding strength in recognizing that your response is within your control.
