None of these will force you to die, but all will teach you how to die. None of them will exhaust your years, but each will contribute his years to yours.

In Seneca's wisdom, he invites us to consider the companionship and guidance books and teachers can provide throughout our lives—not as forces of inevitability, like death, but as quiet mentors of preparation and wisdom. Every book we read, every story we listen to, adds layers to our understanding of life and its end, just as friends or mentors might. They each offer a perspective, a lesson that gently prepares us for the inevitable, without hastening our journey to it. This idea fits seamlessly into today’s bustling world where personal development is often highlighted. For example, consider how reading biographies or engaging in discussions with diverse individuals can expand your horizon, gradually teaching you about resilience, patience, and acceptance. Each encounter doesn’t diminish the time you have but enriches it, adding depth and wisdom. The narratives you absorb, the people you meet—all lend fragments of themselves, enhancing not only the quality of your current years but also contributing to how you embrace the natural conclusion of life with understanding and tranquility.
