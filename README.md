You’ve given aid and they’ve received it. And yet, like an idiot, you keep holding out for more: to be credited with a Good Deed, to be repaid in kind. Why?

When we help others, often there's an unspoken hope of receiving gratitude or acknowledgment in return. However, Marcus Aurelius encourages us to let go of such expectations. The essence of true kindness lies in acting for the sake of the act itself, not for the accolades or rewards that might follow. Consider the joy of giving a thoughtful gift to a friend or volunteering for a community project. The intrinsic value is in the difference made and the joy of contributing, not in receiving verbal praise or a spotlight. Holding out for credit turns a generous act into a transaction, which diminishes its purity. In today's world, where social media sometimes amplifies our desire for public acknowledgment, it becomes crucial to cultivate inner satisfaction from quietly knowing that your actions have made a positive impact. This approach not only fosters genuine generosity but also aligns with the Stoic ideal of focusing on what we can control—our intentions and deeds—not on how others respond.
