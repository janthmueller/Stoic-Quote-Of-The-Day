    <em>"If some one tells you that so and so speaks ill of you, do not defend yourself against what he says, but answer, 'He did not know my other faults, or he would not have mentioned these alone.'"</em><br>
    <strong>— Marcus Aurelius</strong>

    When someone criticizes or speaks ill of you, it's easy to feel defensive or hurt. However, Marcus Aurelius suggests a humble and insightful mindset we can adopt. Instead of rushing to defend ourselves or retaliating, we can acknowledge that we, like everyone else, have imperfections. By humorously accepting that the critic could have targeted even more of our faults if they truly knew us, we defuse the tension and demonstrate self-awareness. In our day-to-day interactions, whether at work or in personal relationships, this approach can help maintain our peace of mind. Instead of getting caught up in negative emotions, we can focus on what truly matters: our own growth and understanding of ourselves. By adopting this attitude, we divert our energy from defending our ego to accepting that human qualities include both strengths and weaknesses. This acceptance makes room for improvement and allows us to live more harmoniously with those around us. Rather than letting unwelcome opinions weigh us down, we can continually strive to be better, recognizing that nobody is perfect and that’s perfectly okay.
