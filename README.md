The supreme ideal does not call for any external aids. It is homegrown, wholly self-developed. Once it starts looking outside itself for any part of itself it is on the way to being dominated by fortune.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
The essence of true fulfillment and strength lies within our own selves, cultivated by our inner resources and self-mastery. Relying on external factors for our sense of identity or happiness places our well-being at the mercy of circumstances beyond our control. Just as a tree depends on its roots more than the changing weather to stand firm, we too should develop our core values, resilience, and wisdom internally. This concept can be seen in everyday situations: consider how a person who ties their self-worth to their job title might feel vulnerable when facing changes in the workplace. In contrast, someone who centers their value on inner qualities like self-discipline, integrity, and adaptability remains stable even amidst uncertainties. By nurturing qualities that do not depend on external validation or fortune, we become more resilient to life's unpredictable nature, finding peace and contentment that are not easily swayed by outside influences. Embracing this self-sufficiency, we position ourselves to navigate life's ups and downs with grace and poise, rather than being swept along by them.
