<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Just as we would not get upset with someone for having a natural, albeit unpleasant, body odor, Marcus Aurelius suggests we should extend the same understanding to people's character flaws or behaviors. Human beings each have their imperfections, much like a natural scent, and at times these imperfections can manifest as actions or words that might annoy or upset us. Getting angry or frustrated with others for being who they are is as futile as being upset with the sun for setting. In everyday life, this could mean encountering someone who is consistently late or someone who speaks bluntly without realizing it hurts feelings. Rather than focusing anger or resentment towards them, recognizing that these are simply parts of their nature can help us respond with patience and compassion. Acceptance of the inherent imperfections in others opens the path to a deeper, more genuine understanding and allows us to maintain our peace of mind amid life's unchangeable routines.
