<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
During times of prosperity, when everything seems to be going our way, friends often appear numerous and readily available, drawn to our success and the comforts that come with it. This is akin to how, in today's world, when someone is achieving career success, throwing lavish parties, or sporting the latest gadgets, many will flock to them, eager to share in their apparent abundance and joys. However, the true test of friendship arises during adversity—those difficult periods marked by personal struggles, failures, or losses. In such moments, when financial stability might waver, health issues may loom, or personal challenges present themselves, fair-weather companions tend to disappear, underscoring the scarcity of genuine support. It's during these challenging times that one discovers who their true friends are, those rare individuals who, regardless of circumstances, remain steadfast in offering empathy, support, and encouragement. This idea, deeply rooted in Stoic philosophy, invites us to cherish and nurture these authentic relationships, understanding that the value of true friends is measured not by their presence in good times, but by their unwavering loyalty and support in the face of hardship.
