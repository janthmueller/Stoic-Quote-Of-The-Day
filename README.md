<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Epictetus highlights the powerful influence that other people's perspectives and challenges can have on our mental and emotional states. It's like when you spend time with someone who is perpetually stressed or negative; their outlook can subtly shift your own thinking in ways that are not always beneficial. Just as you might catch a cold by hanging around someone who's ill, you can catch these negative attitudes if you're not careful. This is especially relevant today, when we're constantly exposed to others' opinions and anxieties on social media and in our daily interactions. It's important to be mindful of the company you keep—physically and digitally—because these influences can shape your perception of reality. By surrounding yourself with individuals who embody positivity, resilience, and constructive views, you set a foundation for adopting those same productive attitudes. This doesn’t mean avoiding anyone with problems, but rather it involves being aware of how these interactions can impact your mindset, ensuring you maintain a personal boundary that protects and nurtures your own well-being and outlook on life.
