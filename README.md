<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
In Seneca’s view, the events we encounter in life are not inherently good or bad—they simply are part of the shared human experience. Imagine you miss out on a job promotion; initially, it feels like bad fortune. However, in a broader context, this disappointment might lead you to explore other opportunities you hadn't considered, resulting in personal growth or even a more fulfilling career elsewhere. Alternatively, landing the position could bring unexpected stress or responsibilities that challenge your work-life balance. This perspective encourages us to understand that life's ups and downs are universal—what happens to us is part of being human and not a targeted stroke of luck or misfortune unique to our situation. By embracing this collective viewpoint, we can cultivate resilience and equanimity, finding comfort in the knowledge that we are all navigating similar seas, each wave and calm being part of a larger, interconnected cycle of events that shape our lives.
