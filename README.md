The wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I say "can," I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.

<!--START_SECTION:quote-interpretation-->
Navigating life with self-sufficiency means finding peace within oneself, having an inner resilience that does not waver, even when faced with the loss of companionship. This isn't about wanting to isolate oneself or dismiss the value of friends; rather, it's about building a foundation of internal strength that isn't overly reliant on external factors. Imagine someone who receives a promotion at work and celebrates with friends, enjoying their company immensely. Yet, if circumstances led to those friends moving away or becoming unavailable, their happiness and sense of fulfillment would not crumble. Instead, they would adapt, finding joy in their personal achievements and developing new connections over time. In today's world, where relationships can often be transient—shifting careers, changing cities, or even friendships evolving—having that steady sense of self ensures we can cherish connections without overly depending on them for our inner peace. Embracing self-sufficiency empowers us to appreciate friendships more deeply, savoring their presence while knowing that our core contentment is solid and ever-present.
