    <em>"Fortune attacks us as often as we attack Fortune.  It."</em><br>
    <strong>— Seneca</strong>
</p>

<p align="center" style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;">
    In Seneca's view, the relationship between Fortune and ourselves mirrors a dance of mutual influence, where both have the capacity to impact one another. When we attribute our misfortunes to external circumstances beyond our control, we should consider how our actions and attitudes have played a role in shaping these outcomes. Just as life can present challenges that feel like attacks, our responses to these situations can sometimes worsen them. Imagine a workplace where projects regularly face unexpected hurdles; one could perpetuate stress by reacting with frustration and blame. Instead, acknowledging our part in the process—perhaps by adapting strategies or managing expectations—can lead to a more harmonious interaction with life's unpredictable nature. This reflects the essence of Stoic thought, which teaches us to cultivate resilience by focusing on our responses, knowing that both setbacks and progress often arise from this interplay. Embracing this awareness allows us to navigate life's ups and downs with more grace and less turmoil, making peace with the ebb and flow of Fortune by recognizing the power of our choices amidst it.
